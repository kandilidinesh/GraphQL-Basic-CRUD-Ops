# gql-rw

This is basic CRUD GraphQL API for fetching, creating, deleting and updating the User Messages.

### NOTE
Regarding the connection to DB, you need to have a Postgres installed on your system and the table data is present in the DB.sql file with the queries. Temporarily you can use Mockaroo.com for generating mock data according to the DB file in the project.
